# Quantum_Computing

A central repository for Quantum Information Science. This project documents the transition from theoretical principles—such as single-system logic—to practical implementation across various quantum frameworks.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
* Implementation of quantum circuits (Superposition, Entanglement, Interference).
* Study of Single Systems and Multi-Systems based on the IBM Quantum Learning path.
* Exploration of diverse SDKs including **Qiskit** and **Kratas**.

## 💻 Tech Stack & Frameworks
* **Languages:** Python
* **SDKs:** Qiskit (IBM), Kratas, Aer (Simulators)
* **Environment:** Google Colab / Jupyter Notebooks

## 🚀 Getting Started
To run these notebooks in Google Colab, you will typically need to install the necessary libraries in the first cell:

### For Qiskit:
\`\`\`python
!pip install qiskit qiskit-ibm-runtime qiskit-aer
\`\`\`

### For Kratas:
*(Instructions will be added as exploration begins)*

## 📂 Repository Structure
* `/Fundamentals`: Basics of qubits, gates, and measurement.
* `/Hardware-Experiments`: Jobs submitted to real quantum processors.
* `/Framework-Comparisons`: Implementing the same algorithm across different SDKs.
